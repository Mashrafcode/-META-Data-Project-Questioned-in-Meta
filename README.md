Movie Status Prediction
Assignment
This project is designed to test your understanding of how to build a high-performing classification algorithm to predict whether a particular movie on Rotten Tomatoes is labeled as 'Rotten', 'Fresh', or 'Certified-Fresh'.

There are two approaches that we're going to learn to predict a movie's status in this data project:

by using numerical and categorical features
by using text data (review from the critics)
The dataset that we're going to use to apply each of the approaches above will be different. For the first approach, we're going to use rotten_tomatoes_movies.csv as our dataset. For the second approach, we're going to use rotten_tomatoes_critic_reviews_50k.csv

You can build a machine learning model with any algorithm, but in this task, we're going to focus our attention on predicting the movie status with tree-based algorithms, i.e Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest algorithm.
